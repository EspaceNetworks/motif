-At this time this module only works with ONE google voice account!
-No outbound route creation. You'll have to setup a custom trunk in FreePBX with these rules:
-- Motif/g<accountname>/$OUTNUM$@voice.google.com,,r
---Where <accountname> is the formatted username, with removed '.' & '@'.
---EX: Motif/gandrewnagythe159com/$OUTNUM$@voice.google.com,,r
